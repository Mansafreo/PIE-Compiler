# Introduction to PIE

Welcome to the documentation for the PIE programming language. PIE is a general-purpose, imperative programming language with a simple, C-style syntax. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, while still being powerful enough to build a variety of applications.

## Features

* **Simple and Familiar Syntax:** If you have experience with languages like C, Java, or JavaScript, you will find PIE's syntax to be very familiar.
* **Statically Typed:** PIE is a statically typed language, which helps to catch errors at compile time.
* **Rich Standard Library:** PIE comes with a rich standard library that provides support for arrays, dictionaries, string manipulation, file I/O, networking, and more.
* **No Required `main` Function:** PIE programs can be written as simple scripts without the need for a `main` function, making it easy to write small, quick programs.
* **LLVM-based Compiler:** PIE is compiled to LLVM IR, which means it can be optimized and run on a variety of platforms.
